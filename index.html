        <h5>Decades of research have demonstrated that children’s first years of development are profoundly important to their lifelong health and well-being. Early childhood development influences physical and mental health, learning and social outcomes over the life course and across generations.</h5>
        </br>
        <p>The Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP) has been collecting data on children’s development in BC to “shine the light” on how children are doing and inspire action to promote healthy development and well-being. Wave 8 (data collected 2019-2022) marks 20 years of EDI data collection in BC. This report provides a foundational summary of EDI data across these last two decades, setting the stage for more analysis and research to come.</p>

            <h5>Still 1 in 3</h5>
            <p>In Wave 8, <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold">32.9% or approximately 13,500 kindergarten children in BC are vulnerable on one or more areas critical to their healthy development.</span> Wave 8 is the fifth provincial data collection in a row where more than 30% of children were vulnerable. Almost two decades of research show that the EDI predicts children’s future outcomes; without additional support and care, children who are vulnerable on one or more areas on the EDI are more likely to experience future challenges in their school years and beyond. With this, the level of vulnerability has significant social and economic cost to BC, not simply as children start school but throughout their lives.</p>

            <p>For the third wave in a row, <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold">the two EDI scales with the highest vulnerability rates continue to be Emotional Maturity and Social Competence.</span> This is particularly concerning given that these scales measure behaviours that relate to the most common childhood mental health issues. Indeed, these findings are consistent with other studies that show increase incidences of mental health concerns with young children across Canada (Raising Canada). </p>

And, in Wave 8, there are only two neighbourhoods with vulnerability rates under 15%, but 23 with rates of 45% or higher. These data provide an important lens on the topography of inequities that continue to face BC children and families. </p>

            <p>In BC, the Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP, UBC) has been collecting EDI data province-wide since 2001, gathering data for over 330,000 kindergarten children in the last two decades. EDI data are collected on a three-year schedule called a “Wave” to capture sufficient data in all school districts involved in the province. The EDI questionnaire is completed by kindergarten teachers in participating school districts in February of the school year for each of the children in their classroom. Data for over 41,000 children attending kindergarten were collected during Wave 8.</p>

        <p>In Wave 8, <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold">32.9% or approximately 13,500 of kindergarten children</span> were Vulnerable on One or More Scales of the EDI.This rate is similar to the Wave 7 (data collected 2016-2019) rate of 33.4%. This means that there are still 1 in 3 children arriving in kindergarten vulnerable on one or more areas of development important to their future success. The chart below shows the trend for Vulnerable on One or More Scales of the EDI from Wave 2 (2004-2007) to Wave 8 (2019-2022).</p>

        <div id="trend_vuln1orMore" class="col-lg-12 px-0"></div>

        <p>There has been a meaningful increase in EDI vulnerability rates over the long-term, rising from 29.9% in Wave 2 to 32.9% in Wave 8. While there was a small decrease in the vulnerability rate between Wave 7, at 33.4% (2016-2019) and Wave 8 (32.9%), this difference does not meet the threshold to be a meaningful change.</p>

        <h3>Mulitiple Vulnerabilities in BC</h3>
        <p>The rate for Vulnerable on One or More Scales of the EDI provides a perspective on the overall vulnerability rate for children in BC, but it doesn’t show the complex nature of vulnerability. While many of the province’s children are vulnerable on a single area of development, some are vulnerable on two, three, four or all five scales of the EDI. This suggests that in addition to the increasing rates of vulnerability in the province, the complexity of vulnerability patterns is also increasing. It appears that children and families are experiencing more complex challenges and vulnerable children are experiencing increased struggles across more areas of their lives. </p>

        <div id="stackedBar_multiVuln" class="col-lg-12 px-0"></div>

        <p>Over long-term, between Wave 2 and Wave 8, the percentage of children vulnerable on two or more areas of development has increased (16.1% in Wave 2 to 19.5% in Wave 8) (Figure #). In Wave 8, this represents over 8,000 children vulnerable on multiple areas of development (two or more scales of the EDI).</p>

        <p>The bar chart above shows the trends over time for the percentage of children in BC on track, in flux and vulnerable on the EDI from Wave 2 to Wave 8. In Wave 8, while almost half of children (45.4%) are on track in their overall development, 32.9% are vulnerable in one or more areas of development and another 21.8% are in flux. The range in rates for “overall vulnerability” is higher over time (4.7 percentage points between the lowest and highest rates) than either “overall influx” (2.2%) or “overall on track” (2.1%). In short, <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold">while many children continue to do well across the developmental domains, the increasing prevalence of vulnerability is concerning.</span></p>

As can be seen in the chart, the number of neighbourhoods experiencing lower levels of vulnerability continues to decrease, falling from a high of 25 neighbourhoods to just two in Wave 8. There was also a decrease in the number of high vulnerability neighbourhoods between Wave 7 (33) and Wave 8 (27) – over time, the number of high vulnerability neighbourhoods has been fairly consistent. </p>

The Social Competence and Emotional Maturity scales are associated. Wave 8 data show that in the province, 8% of children are vulnerable on two EDI scales, and of these, 42.5% were vulnerable on both Social Competence and Emotional Maturity scales combined.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The stable trend in EDI vulnerability rates between Wave 7 (2016-2019) and Wave 8 (2019-2022) is perhaps surprising given the immense disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in BC and around the world. Certainly, data collected through the other Child Development Monitoring System tools (CHEQ, MDI, YDI) during this time tell a different story about the impact of the pandemic on the experiences of children and families (link to article).</p>
        <p>The ongoing prevalence of childhood vulnerability, still in 1 in 3, is a continuing concern.  As well, many of the youngest infants and toddlers born and developing during the pandemic have not yet entered the school system. As such, the impact of the pandemic on their development may be enduring and will be captured by future EDI data collections.</p>
        <p>At the community and neighbourhood levels, there is considerable variability in Wave 8 vulnerability rates and trends over time. The opportunity to explore EDI data at the community, neighbourhood and other regional aggregations will be available soon through a new interactive data dashboard – expected release January 2023.</p>
        <p>Overall, there is more to unpack. With Wave 8 marking 20 years of EDI data collection, and a CDMS growing more robust with each year, there is now significant BC-specific child health and well-being data available for analysis and research purposes. This is an exciting time for HELP and our partners in research, government, school districts, and health to explore the data collected and link CDMS data with other administrative datasets to learn more.</p>
