In fact, early childhood development is itself a social determinant of health – influencing physical and mental health, learning and social outcomes over the life course and across generations<sup><a href="#citation1" class="inTextCitation" id="ref1" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">1</a>,<a href="#citation2" class="inTextCitation" id="ref2" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">2</a></sup></p>

              <p>The Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP, UBC) collects data through the Early Development Instrument (EDI) and other Child Development Monitoring System tools in BC with the intent to “shine the light” on how children are doing and inspire action to promote healthy development and well-being. Wave 8 (data collected 2019-2022) marks 20 years of EDI data collection in BC. This report provides a foundational summary of EDI data across these last two decades, setting the stage for more analysis and research to come.

                  <p>In Wave 8, 32.9% (approximately 13,500) kindergarten children are vulnerable on one or more areas critical to their healthy development. Wave 8 is the fifth provincial EDI data collection in a row where more than 30% of children are vulnerable. Almost two decades of research show that the EDI predicts children's future outcomes; without additional support and care, children who are vulnerable on one or more areas of the EDI (overall vulnerability) are more likely to experience future challenges in their school years and beyond. With this, the level of overall vulnerability has significant social and economic cost to BC, not only as children start school but throughout their lives.</p>

                  <h5>Social & Emotional Development Still Rank as Highest Areas of Concern</h5>
                  <p>For the third wave in a row, the two EDI scales with the highest vulnerability rates continue to be Emotional Maturity and Social Competence. This is particularly concerning given that these scales measure behaviours that relate to the most common childhood mental health issues. Indeed, these findings are consistent with other studies that show increase incidences of mental health concerns with young children across Canada.<sup><a href="#citation3" class="inTextCitation" id="ref3" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">3</a>,<a href="#citation4" class="inTextCitation" id="ref4" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">4</a></sup></p>

                  <p>Wave 8 data also continue to reveal large differences in overall vulnerability rates across regions of BC. At the school district level, overall vulnerability rates range from 21.8% at the lowest end to 72.0% at the highest. Additionally, there are only two neighbourhoods with overall vulnerability rates of 15% or lower, but 27 with rates of 45% or higher. These data provide an important lens on the topography of inequities that children and families across BC continue to face.</p>

                  <p>In BC, the Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP, UBC) has been collecting EDI data province-wide since 1999, gathering data for over 330,000 kindergarten children in the last two decades. EDI data are collected on a three-year schedule called a “wave” to capture sufficient data in all school districts involved in the province. The EDI questionnaire is completed by kindergarten teachers in participating school districts in February of the school year for each of the children in their classroom. Data for over 41,000 children attending kindergarten were collected during Wave 8.</p>

              <p>The participation rate for Wave 8 was 88% of children enrolled in participating districts and schools. This rate is consistent with rates seen in earlier waves of data collection. The EDI Wave participation rate is the percentage of kindergarten children enrolled in the school districts involved in EDI data collection whom an EDI questionnaire was completed. EDI data are collected in 57 BC school districts and some participating independent and First Nations schools.</p>

                <h3>Overall Vulnerability</h3>
                <p>In Wave 8, 32.9%, or approximately 13,500 of kindergarten children, were vulnerable on one or more scales of the EDI (overall vulnerability). This rate is similar to the Wave 7 (collected 2016-2019) rate of 33.4%. This means that there are still 1 in 3 children arriving in kindergarten vulnerable on one or more areas of development important to their future success.</p>

                <p>There has been a meaningful increase in EDI overall vulnerability rates over the long-term, rising from 29.9% in Wave 2 to 32.9% in Wave 8. While there was a small decrease in the rate between Wave 7, at 33.4% (2016-2019) and Wave 8 (32.9%), this difference does not meet the threshold to signal a meaningful change. <a class="" href="#meaninfulChangeDescription" data-toggle="collapse" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="meaninfulChangeDescription">What do we mean by meaningful change? <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a></p>

We consider both statistical significance and practical significance when interpreting meaningful change, and limit our reporting of meaningful change to long-term and short-term trends, using the following symbols in the report:</p>

                <p>Over the long-term, the percentage of children vulnerable on two or more areas of development has increased (16.1% in Wave 2 to 19.5% in Wave 8). In Wave 8, this percentage represents over 8,000 children vulnerable on multiple areas of development (two or more scales of the EDI).</p>
                <p>This suggests that in addition to the increasing rates of vulnerability in the province, the complexity of vulnerability patterns is also increasing.

A neighbourhood is classified as urban if it has a population of at least 1,000 people and a population density of at least 400 people per square kilometre. Otherwise, it is rural. Children living in rural neighbourhoods have had consistently lower overall vulnerability rates than children living in urban neighbourhoods across all waves of the EDI; however, this difference has become smaller over time from about four percentage points in the earliest waves to just over one percentage point in recent waves.</p>

                <h3>EDI Scales and Subscales</h3>
                <p>While EDI overall outcomes provide a summary of the developmental health of kindergarten children, more specific information about each area of development can be found at the scale and subscale level. Each scale of the EDI also measures the whole distribution of children's development, identifying if children are on track, at risk, or vulnerable in that specific area of development. <a class="" href="#scalesSubscalesOutcomesIntro" data-toggle="collapse" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="scalesSubscalesOutcomesIntro">Find out More&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a></p>

                        <p class="mb-0"><small>EDI scales measure the full distribution of children’s developmental outcomes. For each of the five EDI scales, children are classified as either on track, at risk and vulnerable based on their scores. EDI subscales also measure the full distribution of outcomes, for each of the 15 subscales. However, instead of classifying these scores, the subscale scores are standardized, which allows direct comparisons between subscales. Also, by using BC Wave 2 data as a baseline for the standardized scores, it is possible to track trends over time, noting if they are getting better or worse.</small></p>

                    <p>Exploring Scale and Subscale-level trends over time, especially long-term trends, can provide insight into which areas of development, in particular, are of most concern. The line chart below shows the trends in vulnerability over time from Wave 2 (2004-2007) to Wave 8(2019-2022) on all five of the EDI scales. [You can explore the trends for each of the scales, and their related subscales, by clicking on the scale of your choice.]</p>

                    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Long-term Vulnerability Trends:</span> Between Wave 2 and Wave 8, there have been meaningful increases in vulnerability in three of the five EDI scales: Physical Health & Well-being, Social Competence and Emotional Maturity. There has been a meaningful decrease in vulnerability on the Language & Cognitive Development scale, and a stable trend on the Communication Skills & General Knowledge scale over the long-term.</p>

For the third wave in a row, Emotional Maturity and Social Competence are the scales with the highest vulnerability rates of all five scales, at 17.5% and 16.3% respectively. These two scales are associated — Wave 8 data show that of the 8% of BC children vulnerable on two EDI scales, 42.5% were vulnerable on both Social Competence and Emotional Maturity scales combined. The developmental aspects assessed on these two scales represent indicators of children's early mental health.</p>

                <p>The stable trend in EDI vulnerability rates between Wave 7 (2016-2019) and Wave 8 (2019-2022) is perhaps surprising given the immense disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collected through the other <a href="https://earlylearning.ubc.ca/monitoring-system/" target="_blank" alt="Monitoring System overview - HELP Website" title="Monitoring System overview - HELP Website">Child Development Monitoring System tools</a>(CHEQ, MDI, YDI) during this same period broaden the story about the <a href="https://earlylearning.ubc.ca/how-is-the-pandemic-impacting-children-families-and-educators-in-bc-new-data-help-explore-the-emerging-story/" target="_blank" alt="Blog post - HELP website" title="Blog post on the Impact of the Pandemic - HELP website">impact of the pandemic</a> on the experiences, health and well-being of children, youth and adults in BC. As well, many of the youngest infants and toddlers born and developing during the pandemic have not yet entered the school system, and will be captured by future EDI data collections.</p>

                        <p>It is possible that new federal and provincial policies to support children and families introduced or expanded since Wave 7 have influenced children’s vulnerability rates during this challenging time. At the provincial level, this included the BC government’s passing of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act<sup><a href="#citation7" class="inTextCitation" id="ref7" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">7</a></sup>, the move toward universal, affordable childcare<sup><a href="#citation8" class="inTextCitation" id="ref8" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">8</a></sup> and the first provincial poverty reduction strategy<sup><a href="#citation9" class="inTextCitation" id="ref9" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">9</a></sup>. At the federal level, there were increases to the Canada Child Benefit<sup><a href="#citation10" class="inTextCitation" id="ref10" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">10</a></sup>, extensions to parental leave<sup><a href="#citation11" class="inTextCitation" id="ref11" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">11</a></sup>, and a commitment to, and investment in, a national early learning and child care strategy.<sup><a href="#citation12" class="inTextCitation" id="ref12" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">12</a></sup></p>

                </div>
                <p>While the pandemic presented a major disruption, federal and provincial pandemic relief programs provided income support for two-thirds of all Canadian adults, three-quarters of the adults in BC (the highest in country)<sup><a href="#citation13" class="inTextCitation" id="ref13" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">13</a></sup>. According to newly released census data, the Canadian low-income rate decreased in 2020, especially for families with children, largely driven by government transfers<sup><a href="#citation14" class="inTextCitation" id="ref14" alt="In text citation link to footnote" title="View citation in footnotes">14</a></sup>.

                <p>The ongoing prevalence of childhood vulnerability – still 1 in 3 – is a continuing concern.

With Wave 8 marking 20 years of EDI data collection, and a Child Development Monitoring System growing more robust with each year, there is now significant BC-specific child development and well-being data available for analysis and research purposes. This is an important time for HELP and our partners in research, government, school districts, and health to explore the data collected and link it with other datasets (including additional Monitoring System tools) to learn more about this developing story.</p>
