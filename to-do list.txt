CHART DESIGN
- numbers on track, at risk for hover?
- text highlighting throughout - ASK KATE AS PART OF REVIEW
- overall outcomes explanation diagram coding

- section breaks - images? red line treatment? different backgrounds?
- responsive design
- animation plan?!
- Plotly JS restyle in scales/subscale section to switch scales and to add labels when a single line is isolated in all scales chart.
- Vuln map time slider through waves

- Multiple vulnerabilities, perhaps pop out the % in the chart description that highlights the change between W2 and W8
- change cursor type on chart hover to cursor when there are not interactions

WEBSITE UPDATES
- note re w7 sd data and w8 provincial
- remove w7 provincial report and add Wave 8 provincial report
