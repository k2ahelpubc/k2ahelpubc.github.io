- add total bc % line chart to multiple vulnerabilities chart?
- add total bc % line chart to overall outcomes chart? 

- numbers on track, at risk at scale level
- Vuln map time slider through waves

CHANGES/UPDATES
- Add “participation 88%” sentence after the “participation and demographics” title
- Charts… standardized look and range, either using 0 as starting point and going up to same # (50%) or taking out #s for charts where #s are embedded in the chart
- Multiple vulnerabilities, make one vulnerability much lighter in colour than 2,3,4,5; add %s for vulnerable on 5 scales into the bar chart (no above because confusing), perhaps pop out the % in the chart description that highlights the change between W2 and W8
- Overall Outcomes… change title to “New Overall Outcomes”
- Graphic… to be revised by Ada, put space between overall and scale level
- Range of V… keep scatterplot, add explanation for chart… add W8 only range for on track and in flux
- NHs under 15% and over 45% - don’t worry about suppression because can’t go back to W2; Kate and Jeremy decided to go with chart… check #s in chart (W7 was 3 for under 15%??)
- Rural/Urban yes, need definitions from Barry (kate to follow up)
- Use one decimal for all #s even if 0 so… 32.4% and 32.0%
- Subscales, add “better to worse” line
- Jeremy and Kate can do content review, goes to Mariana for final sign off
