CHART DESIGN
- Critical Difference on trend charts
- Wave 8 highlights throughout
- instructional text for charts where necessary
- numbers on track, at risk for hover?
- scale subscale secondary nav - INCOMPLETE
- text highlighting throughout - ASK KATE AS PART OF REVIEW

- sidebar nav - NIGEL to work on this

- Add text labels to all scales chart when a line is isolated.
- Multiple vulnerabilities, perhaps pop out the % in the chart description that highlights the change between W2 and W8
- change cursor type on chart hover to cursor when there are not interactions
- Scales subscales coded diagram

- customize png download button

- Vuln map time slider through waves

CHANGES/UPDATES
- Add “participation 88%” sentence after the “participation and demographics” title
- Range of V:
    - add explanation for chart… 
    - add W8 only range for on track and in flux
- NHs under 15% and over 45% - don’t worry about suppression because can’t go back to W2; Kate and Jeremy decided to go with chart… check #s in chart (W7 was 3 for under 15%??)
- Rural/Urban yes, need definitions from Barry (kate to follow up)
- Jeremy and Kate can do content review, goes to Mariana for final sign off
